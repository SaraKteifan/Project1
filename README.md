### Creating Portfolio Using HTML5 and CSS3
#### Project #1

This is my first project at Orange Coding Academy. We are required to create a portfolio webpage using HTML5 and CSS3. I built the structure of my webpage using HTML and designed it using CSS. Some features from Bootstrap framework are also used. I tried to make the webpage responsive for different screens' sizes. The design of the webpage is meant to be simple and easy to deal with.

Links to the wireframe and Mockup of the project are listed down.
